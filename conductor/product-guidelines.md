# Brand Voice
- **Professional & Trustworthy:** Our communication is formal, clear, and authoritative. We emphasize security, stewardship, and reliability in every interaction to reflect the premium nature of the platform.

# Visual Identity
- **Modern & Clean:** The UI features a spacious layout with a clear visual hierarchy. We use a professional color palette (e.g., deep blues and slate greys) and consistent typography to minimize cognitive load and promote ease of use.

# Prose Style
- **Clarity over Cleverness:** We use simple, direct language. Jargon is avoided unless it is essential for church administration or financial compliance.
- **Action-Oriented:** We focus on user actions. Buttons and instructions describe what the user *does* (e.g., "Record Donation") to ensure clarity and efficiency.

# Error Handling
- **Helpful & Reassuring:** When errors occur, we explain what happened and provide actionable steps to resolve the issue. We maintain a calm and professional tone to reassure the user and maintain trust.
